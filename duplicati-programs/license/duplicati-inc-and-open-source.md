# Duplicati Inc & Open Source

Duplicati Inc. is a US-based for-profit entity incorporated in Delaware in March 2024. Duplicati Inc, helps develop the Duplicati Open Source Client and pay for various infrastructure costs. The Duplicati client is fully open source and free to use with no limitations.

Duplicati Inc is founded with an Open Core model, where the open source client is further developed as open source, but with additional enterprise focused tools and services as a paid feature. Being an Open Core company, we believe that a strong open source client and a vibrant open source community is our strongest asset. At the same time, the for-profit model enables us to take on larger development tasks and maintenance that would otherwise not be sustainable with a pure volunteer based project.
