# Monitoring with Duplicati Console

The Duplicati console is a [paid option](https://duplicati.com/pricing) for handling monitoring of Duplicati backups, but has a free usage tier. To get started with the console, head over to the [Duplicati Console](https://app.duplicati.com/app/getting-started/connection-key) page and sign up or log in.

If you connect your local instance to the Duplicati Console, this will automatically enable reporting to  be sent from the Duplicati client to the console. Within the console, visit the [Alert Center](https://app.duplicati.com/app/alert-center/settings) to configure what notifications you want to received.
