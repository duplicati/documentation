# Monitoring with Duplicati Console

The Duplicati console is a [paid option](https://duplicati.com/pricing) for handling monitoring of Duplicati backups, but has a free usage tier. To get started with the console, head over to the [Duplicati Console](https://app.duplicati.com/app/getting-started/connection-key) page and sign up or log in.

On the "[Getting started](https://app.duplicati.com/app/getting-started/connection-key)" page you can see the instructions, and this is essentially to copy-n-paste in the reporting url into the settings page in your Duplicati client. Once set up, all backups will automatically send a report to the console, and you will have a dashboard and the ability to drill down into each machine, each backup configuration and each report.
