# Community docs: storage providers

This page is copied from the community documentation: [See the original version of this page](https://prev-docs.duplicati.com/en/latest/05-storage-providers/)

A storage provider is a destination or a target for your backup data. This could be a local files or folder, a networked storage device, or a cloud storage provider. Duplicati supports many storage providers, both standard protocols and a wide range of proprietary cloud storage solutions. You can configure how each storage provider is used with its own set of options.

When configuring a backup, the storage URL parameter determines which storage provider will be used. Each storage provider has a different URL format which can be used along with the documented options below.

### Local folder or drive[¶](https://prev-docs.duplicati.com/en/latest/05-storage-providers/#local-folder-or-drive) <a href="#local-folder-or-drive" id="local-folder-or-drive"></a>

This backend can be used to read and write data to the local file system. You can also connect to network filesystem via SMB/NFS.

URL Format:

`file://hostname/folder%20for%20backup` `file://\\server\folder%20for%20backup (UNC path)` `"C:\folder for backup"` `file://c:\folder%20for%20backup (Windows)file:///usr/pub/folder%20for%20backup (Linux)`

In order to specify network filesystem that is not mounted into your local filesystem click on `Manually type path` option which allows you to specify the `Folder path` directly in the following format:

`\\hostname_or_ip_address\folder\subfolder`

For example: `\\192.168.1.10\backup`

You can then also specify the Username and password (if required).

Options:

* `--auth-password` The password used to connect to the server. This may also be supplied as the environment variable `AUTH_PASSWORD`.
* `--auth-username` The username used to connect to the server. This may also be supplied as the environment variable `AUTH_USERNAME`.
* `--alternate-destination-marker` This option only works when the `--alternate-target-paths` option is also specified. If there are alternate paths specified, this option indicates the name of a marker file that must be present in the folder. This can be used to handle situations where an external drive changes drive letter or mount point. By ensuring that a certain file exists, it is possible to prevent writing data to an unwanted external drive. The contents of the file are never examined, only file existence.
* `--alternate-target-paths` This option allows multiple targets to be specified. The primary target path is placed before the list of paths supplied with this option. Before starting the backup, each folder in the list is checked for existence and optionally the presence of the marker file supplied by `--alternate-destination-marker`. The first existing path that optionally contains the marker file is then used as the destination. Multiple destinations are separated with a "`;`". On Windows, the path may be a UNC path, and the drive letter may be substituted with an asterisk (`*`), eg.: " \*:\backup ", which will examine all drive letters. If a username and password is supplied, the same credentials are used for all destinations.
* `--use-move-for-put` When storing the file, the standard operation is to copy the file and delete the original. This sequence ensures that the operation can be retried if something goes wrong. Activating this option may cause the retry operation to fail. This option has no effect unless the `--disable-streaming-transfers` options is activated.
* `--force-smb-authentication` If this option is set, any existing authentication against the remote share is dropped before attempting to authenticate.

### FTP[¶](https://prev-docs.duplicati.com/en/latest/05-storage-providers/#ftp) <a href="#ftp" id="ftp"></a>

This provider uses FTP servers to store backups.

URL Format:

`ftp://hostname/folder`

Options:

* `--ftp-passive = false` If this flag is set, the FTP connection is made in passive mode, which works better with some firewalls. If the `ftp-regular` flag is also set, this flag is ignored.
* `--ftp-regular = true` If this flag is set, the FTP connection is made in active mode. Even if the `ftp-passive` flag is also set, the connection will be made in active mode.
* `--auth-password` The password used to connect to the server. This may also be supplied as the environment variable `AUTH_PASSWORD`.
* `--auth-username` The username used to connect to the server. This may also be supplied as the environment variable `AUTH_USERNAME`.
* `--use-ssl` Use this flag to communicate using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) over ftp (ftps).
* `--disable-upload-verify` To protect against network failures, every upload will be attempted verified. Use this option to disable this verification to make the upload faster but less reliable.

### FTP (Alternative)[¶](https://prev-docs.duplicati.com/en/latest/05-storage-providers/#ftp-alternative) <a href="#ftp-alternative" id="ftp-alternative"></a>

### SFTP (SSH)[¶](https://prev-docs.duplicati.com/en/latest/05-storage-providers/#sftp-ssh) <a href="#sftp-ssh" id="sftp-ssh"></a>

Duplicati can use SSH servers to store backups.

URL Format:

`ssh://hostname/folder`

Options:

* `--auth-password` The password used to connect to the server. This may also be supplied as the environment variable `AUTH_PASSWORD`.
* `--auth-username` The username used to connect to the server. This may also be supplied as the environment variable `AUTH_USERNAME`.
* `--ssh-fingerprint` The server fingerprint used for validation of server identity. Format is eg. `ssh-rsa 4096 11:22:33:44:55:66:77:88:99:00:11:22:33:44:55:66`.
* `--ssh-accept-any-fingerprints` To guard against man-in-the-middle attacks, the server fingerprint is verified on connection. Use this option to disable host-key fingerprint verification. You should only use this option for testing.
* `--ssh-keyfile` Points to a valid OpenSSH keyfile. If the file is encrypted, the password supplied is used to decrypt the keyfile. If this option is supplied, the password is not used to authenticate. This option only works when using the managed SSH client. This key may need to be in PEM format, e.g. created with `ssh-keygen -m pem`, if Duplicati reports an error like _openssh key type: ssh-rsa is not supported_.
* `--ssh-key` An url-encoded SSH private key. The private key must be prefixed with `sshkey://`. If the file is encrypted, the password supplied is used to decrypt the keyfile. If this option is supplied, the password is not used to authenticate. This option only works when using the managed SSH client.
* `--ssh-operation-timeout = 0` Use this option to manage the internal timeout for SSH operations. If this options is set to zero, the operations will not time out
* `--ssh-keepalive = 0` This option can be used to enable the keep-alive interval for the SSH connection. If the connection is idle, aggressive firewalls might close the connection. Using keep-alive will keep the connection open in this scenario. If this value is set to zero, the keep-alive is disabled.

### WebDAV[¶](https://prev-docs.duplicati.com/en/latest/05-storage-providers/#webdav) <a href="#webdav" id="webdav"></a>

Duplicati can use WebDAV servers to store backups.

* `--auth-username` The username used to connect to the server. This may also be supplied as the environment variable "AUTH\_USERNAME".
* `--integrated-authentication` If the server and client both supports integrated authentication, this option enables that authentication method. This is likely only available with windows servers and clients.
* `--force-digest-authentication` Using the HTTP Digest authentication method allows the user to authenticate with the server, without sending the password in clear. However, a man-in-the-middle attack is easy, because the HTTP protocol specifies a fallback to Basic authentication, which will make the client send the password to the attacker. Using this flag, the client does not accept this, and always uses Digest authentication or fails to connect.
* `--use-ssl` Use this flag to communicate using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) over http (https).
* `--debug-propfind-file` To aid in debugging issues, it is possible to set a path to a file that will be overwritten with the PROPFIND response

***

> ![](https://prev-docs.duplicati.com/en/latest/icon_info.png) This backend is based on the Microsoft.SharePoint.Client library, and doesn't support features like OAuth or two-factor authentication (2FA). The Microsoft SharePoint v2 backend supports these features.

***

Supports connections to a SharePoint server (including OneDrive for Business).

URL Format:

`mssp://tennant.sharepoint.com/PathToWeb//BaseDocLibrary/subfoldermssp://username:password@tennant.sharepoint.com/PathToWeb//BaseDocLibrary/subfolder`

Use a double slash '//' in the path to denote the web from the documents library.

Options:

* `--auth-password (Password)` Supplies the password used to connect to the server. The password used to connect to the server. This may also be supplied as the environment variable `AUTH_PASSWORD`.
* `--auth-username (String)` Supplies the username used to connect to the server. The username used to connect to the server. This may also be supplied as the environment variable `AUTH_USERNAME`.
