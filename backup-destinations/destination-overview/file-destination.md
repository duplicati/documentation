# File Destination

The most basic destination in Duplicati is the file backend. This backend simply stores the backup data somewhere that is reachable from the file system. The destination can be a network based storage as long as it is mounted when needed, a fixed disk, or a removable media.

The file backend can be chosen with the `file://` prefix where the rest of the destination url is&#x20;
