# File Destination

The most basic destination in Duplicati is the file backend. This backend simply stores the backup data somewhere that is reachable from the file system. The destination can be a network based storage as long as it is mounted when needed, a fixed disk, or a removable media.

Note that for Windows network shares, you may want to use the [CIFS/SMB destination](cifs-aka-smb-destination.md) instead.

The file backend can be chosen with the `file://` prefix where the rest of the destination url is the path.

**Windows example:**

```
file://C:\Data
file://\\server\share\folder
```

**Linux/MacOS example:**

```
file:///home/user
```

For most cases it will also work without the `file://` prefix, but adding the prefix makes the intention clear.

## Improving speed for local filesystems

Since Duplicati is intended to be used with remote systems, it will make a temporary file, and then copy the temporary file to the new location. This enables various retry mechanisms, progress reporting and failure handling that may not be desired with local filesystems.

To change this logic to instead use the operating system `move`command to move the file into place, avoiding a copy, set the option `--use-move-for-put`, on the file backend and also set `--disable-streaming-transfers`. With these two options, all special handling will be removed and the transfer speed should be the optimal possible with the current operating system. Note that setting `--disable-streaming-transfers`will not show any progress during transfers, if you are using the UI, because the underlying copy or move method cannot be monitored.

### Disabling length verification

Because a local storage destination is expected to have a very low latency, the file backend will verify the length of the file after copy. This additional call is usually very fast and does not impact transfers speeds, but can be disabled for slightly faster uploads with `--disable-length-verification`.

## Removable drives (mostly Windows)

For removable drives, the mount path can sometimes change when inserting the drive. This is most prominent on WIndows, where the drive letters are assigned based on what order the drives are connected. To support different paths, you can supply multiple alternate paths with `--alternate-target-paths`, where each path is separated with the system path separator (`;`on Windows, `:`on Linux/MacOS):

```
// Note, the paths are URL encoded here: E:\backupdata;G:\backupdata
file://F:\backupdata?alternate-target-paths=E%3A%5Cbackupdata%3BG%3A%5Cbackupdata
```

If you would like to support any drive letter, you can also use `*` as the drive letter (Windows only):

```
file://*:\backupdata
```

Because using multiple paths could end up attempting to make a backup to the wrong drive, you can use the option `--alternate-destination-marker` to provide a unique marker filename that needs to exist on the destination:

```
file://F:\backupdata?alternate-destination-marker=<filename>
```

Using this option will scan all paths provided, either using the `*` drive letter or `--alternate-target-paths`, and check if the folder contains a folder with the given filename.

## Authentication (Windows Only)

On Windows, the shares can be authenticated with a username and password (not with integrated authentication). This uses a [Windows API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winnetwk/nf-winnetwk-wnetaddconnection2a) to authenticate prior to accessing the share.

To use authentication, provide the `--auth-username` and `--auth-password`arguments to the query. Since the authentication in Windows is tied to the current user context, it is possible that the share is already mounted with different credentials, that may not have the correct permissions.

To guard against this, it is possible to drop the current authentication and re-authenticate prior to acessing the share. This can be done by adding the `--force-smb-authentication` option.
